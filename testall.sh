# A single script to execute your toplevel program against your tests, validating them against the
# expected output from your toplevel program. This script should be written in Python or Bash.
# Your script must validate a positive test by comparing a printed AST against a gold standard AST; it
# must validate a negative test by checking the compilerâ€™s output error against a gold standard of the
# expected error. For examples of both, see the MicroC testsuite and testing
# script.
