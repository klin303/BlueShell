*** Testing Suite ***
test-ls.bs: Creates and runs an executable with path 'ls' and no arguments

*** Compiling the BlueShell Compiler ***
To compile the BlueShell Compiler, run:
  make

*** Run and Validate Tests ***
To run and validate all tests:
./testall.sh -a 

To run and validate a single test:
./testall.sh -s {input-file}.bs

To keep intermediate output files produced during compilation (.s and .llvm files):
./testall.sh -a -keepc

To keep intermediate output files produced during testing (.out and .diff files):
./testall.sh -a -keept

*** Interpreting Testing Results ***
The testall script validates that a BlueShell program succeeds at every step of
compilation. 
If no errors occur, there will be no observable output. 
If an error occurs during compilation, the testall script prints the error and
exits.

If a test's output matches the gold standard, testall will print 'PASSED'.
If a test's output does not match the gold standard, testall will print an error
and the differences between the gold standard and the output. 

*** Compiling a BlueShell program ***
You can compile a BlueShell program with the following command:

./compile.sh {input_file}.bs

This produces a file named {input_file}.exe, which can be run using ./{input_file}.exe
